  <h2>CRASH LOYAL 도둑에 대하여..</h2>
  hello web! i am the master of the <a href="https://clashroyale.com/ko/"
  target="_blank" title="Clash Royal WebSite"> Clash Royal</a>. <br>Mostly i use <Strong><u>BattleRam deck</u> with Bandit and Ice Golem</strong> inside. <br>it is fast, strong, and unpredictable.
  <p style="margin-top:45px;">The Bandit card is unlocked from the Jungle Arena (Arena 9) or a Legendary Chest.
     She is a troop with moderate hitpoints and damage that has the ability to dash to nearby targets, dealing double damage if she hits a target with her dash, similar to a Prince's charge.
     She is immune to damage while dashing. A Bandit card costs 3 Elixir to deploy. She has white hair, wears a mask, and wields a blackjack.</p>
